# Oraghost
This project is actually paused, but I plan to finish it when I get more time.

Oraghost is a 2d rpg with a pixel art style, all the coding, music, the art and the story is made by myself only.

## Story
One day, a ghost wakes up in an intriguing cave. He explores a bit and finds a chest that contains the Sacred Amulet, after taking it, the ghost gets teleported to a shrine in a sunny grass field. Starting from here, it will follow through an incredible adventure and will have to battle the toughest of enemies: itself and its true nature. This is the story of the Oraghost, a creature made by Overlord with a very specific end goal: overtaking God...
